# TO-DO-list project

## About The Project :file_folder:

- A task list contains specific tasks assigned to a task and when the task needs to be done.

- Typically these lists are created at the start of a project.
 
- And are agreed upon by the entire team and the stakeholders.

- You can add to your list and delete your entire list.

```
> npm install 
```

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development :floppy_disk:

```
> npm run serve 
```

```
> npm run build 
```
